# Beehive
File Archive Application  
UI with tkinter  
Developed and tested with Python 3.6.2  
UI works cross-platform  
Logic only works with windows (for now)  

The program will create a Reports folder where it keeps track of all past archive events  

to run the program with the python compiler (only dependant on BeehiveUI.py and Archiver.py):  
python BeehiveUI.py
