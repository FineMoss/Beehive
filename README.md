# Beehive
File Archive Application  
UI with tkinter  
Developed and tested with Python 3.6.2  
UI works cross-platform  
Logic only works with windows (for now)  

The program will create a Reports folder where it keeps track of all past archive events  

The file Beehive.exe is a stand alone deliverable for windows OS  
Just put the .exe anywhere on your machine and it will work  
This was packaged with pyinstaller  

to run the program with the python compiler (only dependant on BeehiveUI.py and Archiver.py):  
python BeehiveUI.py
